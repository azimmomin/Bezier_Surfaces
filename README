Compiling:
	make clean; make; ./bezier testPath subdivision [-a]

	- All items in [] are optional.
	- testPath is the path to the test file. This can be a .obj file or a .bez file.
	- subdivision is the subdivision constant mentioned in the specs. This is optional
	  if you are loading in a .obj file.
	- -a will make the tessellation adaptive.

Required Features:
	 - The UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys rotate the object.
	 - SHIFT + UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT translates the object.
	 - +/- zooms in and out.
	 - Pressing s will toggle smooth/flat shading (default is flat shading)
	 - Pressing w will toggle wireframe/filled mode (default is filled)
	 - The object is auto-centered intially.

Extras:

OBJ Parser:
    Our program takes .obj files and displays the image on the screen. No extra parameters are
    needed. Just specify the .obj file instead of the .bez file
    
    Example: make clean; make; ./bezier tests/obj/airboat.obj

Hidden Line Removal:
    Upon pressing 'h' our program will remove lines that are "hidden" and not visible to the
    viewer. Note that you must be in wireframe mode to see this.

    Example: make clean; make; ./bezier tests/bez/teapot.obj .1

    	     press "w"
	     press "h"
